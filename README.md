> **1. Pitch**

The second dimension an aircraft can move in is called “pitch.” The pitch means the drone tilts upwards or downwards based on its orientation and the location of its nose. A downwards tilt will move the aircraft (drone in this case) in a forwards motion, while an upwards tilt will move it backwards.
