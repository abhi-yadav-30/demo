> **1. Throttle**

<br>

Throttle is just a upward (or downward) movment of quadcopter which can be achived by increasing (or decreasing) all the propeller speeds by the same amount. It leads to a vertical force with respect to body-fixed frame which raises or lowers the quad-rotor.

> **2. Pitch**

<br>

The second dimension an aircraft can move in is called “pitch.” The pitch means the drone tilts upwards or downwards based on its orientation and the location of its nose. A downwards tilt will move the aircraft (drone in this case) in a forwards motion, while an upwards tilt will move it backwards.

<br>

> **3. Yaw**

<br>

“yaw” refers to the direction the front of your drone (or even a plane or car) is facing when rotating either clockwise or counterclockwise (or left and right if you prefer) on its vertical axis.

> **4. Altitude hold**

<br>

 the throttle is automatically controlled to maintain the current altitude.
 
 <br>
 
 > **5. Hover**

<br>

two of a drone's four rotors move clockwise, while the other two move counterclockwise, ensuring that the sideways momentum of the drone remains balanced.

<br>

 > **6. Geographical fence**

<br>

This is the use of GPS to create a virtual boundary that triggers a predetermined response when the drone flies into — or out of — a particular area. If the drone flies towards a “fenced” or restricted area, it will stop mid-flight. If you try to take off from a restricted area, the drone will not start up at all. Geofences can be placed to keep drones out of certain fields, from flying over a particular building, and prevent them from entering into “no fly zones.”
