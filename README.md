6. Geographical fence

> **1. Pitch**

The second dimension an aircraft can move in is called “pitch.” The pitch means the drone tilts upwards or downwards based on its orientation and the location of its nose. A downwards tilt will move the aircraft (drone in this case) in a forwards motion, while an upwards tilt will move it backwards.

> **2. Yaw**

“yaw” refers to the direction the front of your drone (or even a plane or car) is facing when rotating either clockwise or counterclockwise (or left and right if you prefer) on its vertical axis.

> **3. Throttle**
Throttle is just a upward (or downward) movment of quadcopter which can be achived by increasing (or decreasing) all the propeller speeds by the same amount. It leads to a vertical force with respect to body-fixed frame which raises or lowers the quad-rotor.
